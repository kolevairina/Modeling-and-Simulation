# Modeling-and-Simulation
This repository contains the Python code needed to reproduce figures from the manuscript: **COVID-19: Catalyst for US Prison Reform**, which modeled a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in the US federal prison population. 

For this project, a vulnerable population was identified, a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was predicted using an SIERD model, various mitigation strategies were modeled, and predictions were given based on the outcomes of those models.

To generate figures or tables from the manuscript, follow these steps:
    1. Download or clone this entire repository into any local directory.
    2. Open the .ipynb file included; Jupyter Notebook is recommended.
    3. Follow the steps listed out and run each cell with code in it as instructed. All necessary packages and libraries are already included. No additional raw data is necessary.
