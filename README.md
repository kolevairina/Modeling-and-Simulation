# Modeling-and-Simulation
This repository contains the raw data and Python code needed to reproduce figures from the manuscript: **COVID-19: Catalyst for US Prison Reform**, which modeled a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in the US federal prison population. For this project, a vulnerable population was identified, a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was predicted using an SIERD model, various mitigation strategies were modeled, and predictions were given based on the outcomes of those models.
