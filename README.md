# Modeling-and-Simulation
This repository contains the Python code needed to reproduce figures from the manuscript: **COVID-19: Catalyst for US Prison Reform**, which modeled a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in the US federal prison population. 

For this project, a vulnerable population was identified, a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was predicted using an SIERD model, various mitigation strategies were modeled, and predictions were given based on the outcomes of those models.

To generate figures or tables from the manuscript, follow these steps:
    1. Download or clone this entire repository into any local directory.
    2. Open the .ipynb file included; Jupyter Notebook is recommended.
    The figures in the **"Figures"** folder correspond to the figures in the Python code.  
    3. Follow the steps listed out and run each cell as instructed without making any changes to the code. Figures will be displayed directly in the Jupyter Notebook environment and will be saved into the same folder that the .ipynb file is located in. 
    
All necessary packages and libraries are already included in the code. No additional raw data is necessary.
